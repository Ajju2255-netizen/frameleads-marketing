  const linkedinAdsFaqData = [
    {
      question: "How much do LinkedIn ads cost?",
      answer: "LinkedIn advertising costs typically range from $5-15 per click, depending on your targeting and industry. Most B2B companies invest $3,000-10,000+ per month in LinkedIn ads for effective lead generation. Our LinkedIn ads management services start at $2,500/month with transparent pricing and no hidden fees."
    },
    {
      question: "What are LinkedIn ads and how do they work?",
      answer: "LinkedIn ads are professional advertising campaigns that appear in LinkedIn feeds, messages, and sidebars to target business professionals. Unlike Google Ads which target keywords, LinkedIn advertising targets professionals based on job title, company, industry, and other professional attributes, making it ideal for B2B lead generation."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results from LinkedIn advertising?",
      answer: "LinkedIn ads results typically follow this timeline: Week 1-2 for campaign setup and optimization, Week 3-4 for initial data collection, Month 2 for performance improvements, Month 3+ for sustained lead generation growth. Most B2B companies see 25-40% improvement in lead quality within 60 days."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between LinkedIn ads vs Google ads?",
      answer: "LinkedIn ads vs Google ads serves different purposes: LinkedIn targets professionals based on job attributes and generates demand among B2B decision-makers, while Google Ads captures existing demand through search intent. LinkedIn advertising typically has higher CPCs but delivers better lead quality for B2B companies, while Google Ads offers broader reach at lower costs."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes your LinkedIn advertising agency different?",
      answer: "Our LinkedIn advertising agency stands out through: LinkedIn Marketing Partner status with $25M+ managed B2B spend, specialized B2B lead generation expertise, advanced professional targeting capabilities, transparent reporting with real-time dashboards, ROI focus with every campaign optimized for B2B goals, and no long-term contracts with month-to-month flexibility."
    },
    {
      question: "What industries benefit most from LinkedIn advertising?",
      answer: "LinkedIn marketing services work best for B2B industries including SaaS/technology, professional services, healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, and education. Any business targeting professionals, decision-makers, or other businesses can benefit from LinkedIn ad campaigns due to the platform's professional audience and advanced targeting capabilities."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you measure LinkedIn ads performance and ROI?",
      answer: "We track comprehensive LinkedIn advertising metrics including click-through rates, conversion rates, cost per lead, lead quality scores, and return on ad spend (ROAS). Our monthly reports include detailed campaign analysis, audience insights, and strategic recommendations for continuous LinkedIn ads optimization."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide LinkedIn ads training and consultation?",
      answer: "Yes, our LinkedIn ads agency provides comprehensive training including Campaign Manager setup, targeting best practices, creative optimization, and performance analysis. We also offer consultation services for businesses who prefer to manage LinkedIn advertising in-house while receiving strategic guidance."
