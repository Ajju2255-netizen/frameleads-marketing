# Digital Marketing in United States - Page Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains the page component for Frameleads' digital marketing services targeting the United States market.

## Current Status
⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTICE**: The current `page.tsx` file appears to be a copy of the Bangalore digital marketing page and needs to be updated to properly target the United States market.

### Issues Identified
1. **Function Name Mismatch**: The component is named `DigitalMarketingInBangalorePage` but should be `DigitalMarketingInUnitedStatesPage`
2. **Content Mismatch**: All content references Bangalore instead of United States
3. **Location Data**: Business districts, areas, and local references are all Bangalore-specific
4. **Currency**: Pricing is in Indian Rupees (₹) instead of US Dollars ($)
5. **Contact Information**: Phone numbers and addresses are India-specific
6. **SEO Data**: Schema markup and meta information references Bangalore
