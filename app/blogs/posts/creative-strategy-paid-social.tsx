            Paid social is a battle for attention. You have milliseconds to stop the scroll. Here is the
            strategy for winning creatives on Meta and TikTok.
        </p>
        <h2>The 3-Second Hook</h2>
        <p>
            If you don't catch them in 3 seconds, you lost them. Use visual disruption or a strong text
            hook.
        </p>
        <h2>The Offer</h2>
        <p>
            Even the best ad can't sell a bad offer. Make your offer irresistible and clear.
        </p>
        <h2>UGC vs. Polished Ads</h2>
        <p>
            User Generated Content (UGC) builds trust. Polished ads build authority. Use a mix of both for
            maximum impact.
