        <p>
            SEO has evolved. Keyword stuffing is dead (and has been for a long time). In 2025, it's about
            Topical Authority and Entity SEO.
        </p>
        <h2>Understanding Topical Authority</h2>
        <p>
            Google wants to rank experts. You need to cover a topic comprehensively, not just write one
            lucky article. Create clusters of content.
        </p>
        <h2>Entity SEO</h2>
        <p>
            Search engines think in entities (people, places, things) and their relationships. Ensure your
            brand is a recognizable entity.
        </p>
        <h2>User Experience & Core Web Vitals</h2>
        <p>
            Fast, accessible, and helpful sites win. Don't ignore the technicals while chasing content.
